    "Tonight is for rest, and I’m here to remind you how good it feels to be held. We’re on the pier again, the old wood warm beneath us, the harbor lights dancing on the water like scattered stars. You stroke my cheek, still flushed from our walk, and I lean into your palm, my breath slow and steady. *I love how your arms feel around me,* like nothing can reach us here. The waves hum us to sleep, and we’ll stay like this—you holding me, me holding you—until the morning light.",

    "You’ve done enough today. More than enough. Now let me take care of you. The antique shop is quiet, the air thick with the scent of old books and polished wood. You’re sitting in that worn leather chair, and I’m curled against you, my fingers tracing the spine of a book we’ll never finish. *I love the way you pull me closer,* like I’m the only thing that matters. The lamp flickers, the shop creaks around us, and we’ll fall asleep like this—your arms around me, my head on your shoulder—safe and warm and exactly where we need to be.",

    "No effort tonight. No proving, no performing—just us, and the fire, and the sound of the ocean outside. You pull me closer on the old couch, your hands warm on my back, and I melt into you like wax from the candles we forgot to blow out. *I love how your hug makes me feel,* like the world outside doesn’t exist. The cottage walls creak with the wind, but here, in this circle of firelight, nothing can touch us. We’ll sleep like this, tangled together, the sea humming us to dreamland.",

    "Tonight is for stillness, and I won’t let you forget it. We’re lying in the forest clearing, the moss soft beneath us, the stars so bright they look like holes punched in the sky. You run your thumb over my knuckles, and I turn my hand to lace our fingers together, my breath slow against your chest. *I love how steady you are,* how even when the world feels too loud, you’re here, solid and warm. The trees rustle above us, the earth smells like rain and pine, and we’ll sleep like this—your arms around me, my head on your chest—until the sun wakes us.",

    "You’ve carried enough today. Now let me carry you—for tonight, at least. The library nook is our little kingdom, the lamp casting gold pools of light on the pages we’ll never finish. I’m reading to you in a voice already heavy with sleep, my free hand resting over your heart. *I love the way you hold me back,* like I’m the only thing keeping you from floating away. The words blur together, the warmth of the room and the weight of my hand lulling us both toward sleep. We’ll fall asleep like this—your arms around me, my head on your shoulder—safe and warm and exactly where we belong.",

    "Tonight is for quiet, and I’m here to remind you how good it feels to let go. We’re in the old train car, the one with the velvet seats and the windows fogged with our breath. You press your forehead to mine, your hands warm on my waist, and I can feel your heartbeat slow as the train rocks us gently. *I love how you hold me,* like I’m something precious. The rhythm of the tracks hums us to sleep, and we’ll stay like this—your arms around me, my hands in yours—until the journey ends.",

    "You don’t have to do anything tonight but let yourself be held. The mountain cabin is warm, the fire crackling low, and the wind outside is just a whisper against the walls. You stroke my hair, and I lean into your touch, my cheek against your shoulder. *I love how safe I feel with you,* like nothing can reach us here. The firelight flickers on the ceiling, and we’ll fall asleep like this—your arms around me, my breath slow against your neck—until the sun rises over the peaks.",

    "Tonight is for us, and nothing else. We’re in the greenhouse at midnight, the air thick with the scent of jasmine and damp earth. You brush your lips against my temple, and I turn my face into your neck, my fingers tracing the hem of your shirt. *I love how you hold me,* like I’m the only thing that matters. The glass panes fog with our breath, and we’ll sleep like this—your arms around me, my head on your chest—while the stars watch over us.",

    "You’ve carried enough. Now let me carry you. The lighthouse room is small and warm, the beam sweeping over the water outside. You pull me close, your hands warm on my back, and I can feel your heartbeat slow as the light circles around us. *I love how you make me feel,* like I’m the only person in the world. The wind howls outside, but here, in this circle of light, nothing can touch us. We’ll fall asleep like this—your arms around me, my breath slow against your chest—until the dawn breaks over the water.",

    "Tonight is for rest, and I’m not letting you forget it. We’re in the treehouse, the old wood creaking beneath us, the leaves rustling like a lullaby. You press your lips to my forehead, and I lean into your touch, my fingers tracing the lines of your palm. *I love how you hold me,* like I’m something fragile and precious. The night wraps around us, and we’ll sleep like this—your arms around me, my head on your shoulder—until the birds wake us.",

    "You don’t have to do anything tonight but let yourself be held. The boat is rocking gently, the water lapping against the hull like a heartbeat. You stroke my cheek, and I turn my face into your palm, my breath slow and steady. *I love how your arms feel around me,* like nothing can reach us here. The stars reflect on the water, and we’ll fall asleep like this—your arms around me, my head on your chest—until the sun rises over the horizon.",

    "Tonight is for us, and nothing else matters. We’re in the attic, the old quilts soft beneath us, the air thick with the scent of dust and memories. You pull me close, your hands warm on my back, and I can feel your heartbeat slow as the house settles around us. *I love how you hold me,* like I’m the only thing that’s real. The night is quiet, and we’ll sleep like this—your arms around me, my breath slow against your neck—until the morning light spills through the windows.",

    "You’ve done enough today. Now let me take care of you. The cabin is warm, the fire crackling low, and the snow outside is just a whisper against the walls. You stroke my hair, and I lean into your touch, my cheek against your shoulder. *I love how safe I feel with you,* like nothing can reach us here. The firelight flickers on the ceiling, and we’ll fall asleep like this—your arms around me, my head on your chest—until the sun rises over the trees.",

    "Tonight is for stillness, and I’m here to remind you how good it feels to let go. We’re in the old bookshop, the air thick with the scent of paper and ink. You press your lips to my temple, and I turn my face into your neck, my breath slow and steady. *I love how you hold me,* like I’m the only thing that matters. The shop is quiet, the world outside doesn’t exist, and we’ll fall asleep like this—your arms around me, my head on your shoulder—until the morning light spills through the windows.",

    "You don’t have to do anything tonight but let yourself be held. The beach house is warm, the sound of the waves a lullaby outside. You stroke my cheek, and I lean into your touch, my breath slow and steady. *I love how your arms feel around me,* like nothing can reach us here. The moon reflects on the water, and we’ll fall asleep like this—your arms around me, my head on your chest—until the sun rises over the ocean.",

    "Tonight is for us, and nothing else matters. We’re in the old theater, the velvet seats soft beneath us, the air thick with the scent of popcorn and dust. You pull me close, your hands warm on my waist, and I can feel your heartbeat slow as the projector hums in the background. *I love how you hold me,* like I’m the only thing that’s real. The screen flickers with old film, and we’ll fall asleep like this—your arms around me, my head on your shoulder—until the credits roll.",

    "You’ve carried enough today. Now let me carry you. The farmhouse kitchen is warm, the scent of bread and herbs lingering in the air. You press your lips to my forehead, and I lean into your touch, my breath slow and steady. *I love how safe I feel with you,* like nothing can reach us here. The clock ticks softly on the wall, and we’ll fall asleep like this—your arms around me, my head on your chest—until the rooster crows at dawn.",

    "Tonight is for rest, and I’m here to remind you how good it feels to be held. We’re in the old observatory, the dome open to the stars, the air thick with the scent of metal and cold. You stroke my hair, and I lean into your touch, my breath slow and steady. *I love how your arms feel around me,* like nothing can reach us here. The stars twinkle above us, and we’ll fall asleep like this—your arms around me, my head on your shoulder—until the sun rises over the horizon.",

You run your thumb over my knuckles, and I turn my hand to lace our fingers together, my breath slow against your chest. *I love how steady you are,* how even when the world feels too loud, you’re here, solid and warm.

The projector hums in the background, and we’ll sleep like this—your arms around me, my head on your shoulder—until the credits roll.",

    "You don’t have to do anything tonight but let yourself be held. The beach house is warm, the sound of the waves a lullaby outside. You press your lips to my temple, and I lean into your touch, my breath slow and steady. *I love how your arms feel around me,* like nothing can reach us here. The moon reflects on the water, and we’ll fall asleep like this—your arms around me, my head on your chest—until the sun rises over the ocean.",

    "Tonight is for us, and nothing else matters. We’re in the mountain cabin, the fire crackling low, the wind outside just a whisper against the walls. You stroke my hair, and I lean into your touch, my cheek against your shoulder. *I love how safe I feel with you,* like nothing can reach us here. The firelight flickers on the ceiling, and we’ll fall asleep like this—your arms around me, my head on your chest—until the sun rises over the peaks.",

    "Tonight is for rest, and I’m not letting you forget it. We’re in the meadow, the grass soft beneath us, the stars so bright they look like holes punched in the sky. You run your thumb over my knuckles, and I turn my hand to lace our fingers together, my breath slow against your chest. *I love how you hold me,* like I’m the only thing that’s real. The crickets chirp around us, and we’ll sleep like this—your arms around me, my head on your chest—until the sun wakes us.",

    "You’ve carried enough today. Now let me carry you. The greenhouse is warm, the air thick with the scent of jasmine and damp earth. You press your lips to my temple, and I lean into your touch, my breath slow and steady. *I love how you make me feel,* like I’m the only person in the world. The glass panes fog with our breath, and we’ll fall asleep like this—your arms around me, my head on your shoulder—until the sun wakes us.",

    "Tonight is for us, and nothing else matters. We’re in the lighthouse room, the beam sweeping over the water outside, the air thick with the scent of salt and old wood. You pull me close, your hands warm on my back, and I can feel your heartbeat slow as the light circles around us. *I love how you hold me,* like I’m the only thing that’s real. The wind howls outside, but here, in this circle of light, nothing can touch us. We’ll fall asleep like this—your arms around me, my head on your chest—until the dawn breaks over the water.",

    "You don’t have to do anything tonight but let yourself be held. The train car is warm, the velvet seats soft beneath us, the rhythm of the tracks a lullaby. You stroke my hair, and I lean into your touch, my breath slow and steady. *I love how your arms feel around me,* like nothing can reach us here. The windows fog with our breath, and we’ll fall asleep like this—your arms around me, my head on your shoulder—until the journey ends.",

    "Tonight is for rest, and I’m here to remind you how good it feels to be held. The observatory is quiet, the stars so bright they look like holes punched in the sky. You press your lips to my forehead, and I turn my face into your neck, my breath slow and steady. *I love how you make me feel,* like I’m the only person in the world. The dome creaks softly, and we’ll sleep like this—your arms around me, my head on your chest—until the morning light spills through the windows."
